TextRect

Approaches:
"Rebuild and Draw"
- When text changes, recalculate dimensions and store it in a list of lines
- On draw, index through the list of lines and draw words with their appropriate style
- This way, you only calculate line dimensions once, and draw just becomes indexing styles and text

Rebuild()
- parse into "style blocks"
	- associate {style, text}
- calculate lines
	- append style blocks together, if they go over, append it to the next line. 

lines = 
{
	{ {default, "default text"}, {bold, " bold text"}, {italic, "this text wra"} },
	{ {italic, "ps to a new line. and then it"}, {default, "continues normally"} }
} 

Draw()
- iterate through lines
- set style
- draw text
