#text-formatting

Text can be formatted with **bold**, *italics* and size, and color according to the following formatting.

```
<b>this is some bold text</b>
<i>this is some italicized text</i>
<c=#FFFFFF>this text will be colored</c>
<s=24>this text will be size 24</s>
```

By default, text will adhere to the **default font** and **default color** defined by the system. Any variations will automatically revert back to these defaults.
